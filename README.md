# FaceAlert

Developed a real-time security alert system using face recognition to scan individuals at checkpoints (example: hotels, airports etc.) and verify them against a wanted dataset. If no match is found, a safe alarm is triggered, indicating the individual is clear to proceed. If a match is detected, the system activates a threat alarm and sends an email alert to authorities.

# Tech Stack: OpenCV, face_recognition, SMTPLib, Winsound

# Features:
1. The system scans individuals and detects faces.

2. Compares detected faces against a dataset of wanted/banned individuals.

3. The system takes 10 seconds to analyze and confirm the match before coming to a conclusion.

4. if no match is found a safe_alarm is triggered indicating the person is harmless and safe to go.

5. if a match is found a threat_alarm is triggered and an email is sent directly to the authorities notifying them of the potential threat.

# Workflow:
1. Dataset: The dataset contains different folders for each wanted individual. The folder contains images of that individual.

2. Face Encoding & Labeling: The system loads all images, extracts facial features using face_recognition, and encodes them into numerical vectors.It then assigns each encoding to the personâ€™s name based on the folder structure.

3. Real time face recognition: Scans the individuals face using OpenCV. Detects and extracts faces in real time. Compares detected faces against stored encodings using distance metricsIf similarity is above a certain threshold (< 0.4), the person is identified.

4. Identity Confirmation:  The system takes 10 second to analyze and confirm the match. If the match remains consistent for 10 seconds and the alarm has not been trigerred for last 30 seconds, it triggers the alarm based on the match type: safe_alarm for "No match" and threat_alarm for "match".

5. Email Notification: If a threat is identified and threat_alarm is trigerred an email is sent to authorities including the name, photo, time and Ip location of the individual. The authorities can be the organisation security, admin, police authorities, local authorities, public safety etc.
